## üíª Code Structure

   The code is structured in the following way:
   
   The primary entry point for the application is Program.cs. contains the primary menu structure as well as tools for adding people, projects, and recording time      worked.

   PostgresqlConnection.cs is a static class that uses Dapper and Npgsql to manage all database interactions. 

   Contains methods for creating a user, a project, retrieving a user or project by name, and logging the amount of time a person spent working on a project.

   Entity models used in the program are housed in the subdirectory called "SQLModels."
